Hello Curtis,
 
Recently, my colleague in the Assembly Mark Spreitzer and I introduced LRB-0951, which would bring instant runoff ranked-choice voting to most Wisconsin elections. It is my understanding we cannot do this for Recall elections without a change to the State Constitution.
 
You can find text of the bill attached to this email. Interestingly, one side effect of our bill that is quite advantageous would be the elimination of the February non-partisan primary. This would save state and local governments millions of dollars.
 
We are seeking co-sponsors in the legislature now, so we will have a better idea of what level of support we have, including among Republicans who control the majority in our legislature, in the near future.
 
Thanks for your interest!
Chris Larson

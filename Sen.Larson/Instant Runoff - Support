Hello Curtis,
 
Last session, my colleague in the Assembly Mark Spreitzer and I introduced Assembly Bill 150 which would have brought instant runoff ranked-choice voting to Wisconsin elections excluding Recall elections. It is my understanding we cannot do this for Recall elections without a change to the State Constitution.
 
Interestingly, the bill removes the February non-partisan primary as a side effect. This would have saved state and local governments millions of dollars.
 
Unfortunately, the bill was adversely disposed of during the Senate Joint Resolution 1.
 
While I am a firm supporter of ranked choice voting in Wisconsin, by the Senate Joint Resolution 1, I cannot reintroduce the bill until the 2021-2022 biennial session period has ended.
 
In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me if you have any additional questions or suggestions.
 
Thanks for your interest!
Chris Larson
